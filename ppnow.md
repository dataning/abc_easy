| AI Agents in Red Teaming Exercises Cause Breaches           | Susceptibility to indirect prompt injections and adversarial inputs embedded in external data sources (e.g., user-generated content, emails); lack of robust defenses against simulated attacks.                     | 62,000+ breaches from 1.8M attacks; data leakage (e.g., emails via calendars); financial losses in simulations transferable to live systems.                               | Developed robust vulnerability testing; added multi-layered defenses like encryption and access throttling; shared findings for community-wide improvements.                  | High (>50%): 2025 reports emphasize evolving AI threats, with red teaming revealing persistent vulnerabilities and a need for ongoing countermeasures like output filtering.                                                                                                              | Adopt large-scale red-teaming in evaluation phases; benchmark against human exploits and track cascading failures to build resilient multi-agent systems in our development pipeline.                                                 |

To evaluate risks in AI solutions, particularly agentic or autonomous systems, I've developed a customizable risk matrix based on your specified categories. This draws from established frameworks like NIST's AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF), the Cloud Security Alliance's MAESTRO for agentic AI threat modeling, McKinsey's 3x3 decision autonomy matrix (balancing risk and complexity), and best practices from sources on AI agent governance, such as human-in-the-loop (HITL) requirements and code sandboxing.

#### Aggregated Risk Levels & Overall Recommendations

- **Low Risk (8-12)**: Solution is well-contained. Recommendation: Annual reviews and basic logging. Mitigation: Focus on monitoring for emerging threats like model drift.
- **Medium Risk (13-18)**: Balanced but with gaps. Recommendation: Conduct quarterly red-teaming exercises. Mitigation: Integrate AI TRiSM (Trust, Risk, and Security Management) pillars, such as runtime inspections and bias checks.
- High Risk (19-24): Urgent action needed. Recommendation: Pause deployment for full audit using MAESTRO's 7-layer decomposition (e.g., assess layers like data ingestion and action execution). Mitigation: Enforce graduated autonomy (e.g., AI assists but humans decide in high-complexity scenarios) and deploy governance tools for continuous compliance.
