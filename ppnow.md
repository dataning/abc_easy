Real-Estate Examples
Factor Model
⭐️ (Simplest)
• Drastically reduces dimensionality• Well understood by quants• Transparent loadings
• Latent factors may lack intuitive labels• Loadings shift over time
• PCA/FA to extract 3–6 core “risk drivers”• Risk attribution per asset/factor
Rapidly collapse 20+ ML metrics (LTV, DSCR, cap-rate forecasts) plus sentiment-scores into a few core factors for PMs to track
• Verify that the factors map to business concepts (e.g., “market momentum”)• Re-run loadings each quarter to guard against regime shifts
• Factor 1: “Macro Rate & News Sentiment” combines interest-rate forecast and central bank speech tone• Factor 2: “Tenant Health” driven by DSCR, vacancy forecasts, and LLM-flagged complaint topics
Ensemble Trees (RF/GBM)
⭐️⭐️
• Handles mixed numeric/text features naturally• Captures nonlinearities• Built-in feature importance
• Often “black-box” without explainers• Can overfit if not tuned carefully
• High-accuracy risk‐score prediction• Ranking of signal importance
Ideal for generating a daily risk‐score for each property by learning from historical defaults, with clear ranking of which indicators (e.g., negative news spikes) drive risk
• Use SHAP or LIME to translate splits into manager‐friendly narratives• Regularly validate out‐of‐sample performance to avoid drift
• Train model on historical rent-default events using inputs: vacancy forecasts (ML), tenant sentiment score (LLM), local market news polarity (LLM), loan terms (ML)
Hierarchical (Multilevel) Modeling
⭐️⭐️⭐️
• Mirrors natural levels (portfolio → region → asset)• Allows cross-level inference• Retains both macro & micro effects
• Requires well-structured hierarchy• Model specification can be tricky
• Estimates both global and subgroup effects• Integrates text & numbers at each level
Perfect to embed sentiment from national-/city-level news (LLM) into regional risk, then into each building’s ML-based health score
• Ensure enough data per level (e.g., >30 properties per region)• Watch for collinearity between levels (e.g., regional sentiment vs. property‐level features)
• Level 1: national economic sentiment (LLM)• Level 2: submarket vacancy forecast (ML)• Level 3: building‐level DSCR and property‐inspection summary sentiment (LLM)
Bayesian Network
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
• Explicit uncertainty quantification• Intuitive DAG visualization• “What-if” querying
• DAG structure is subjective• Inference scales poorly with node count
• Probabilistic inference• Root-cause diagnosis• Scenario planning
Enables a “digital twin” of your risk ecosystem—e.g., update probability of default when a major zoning change (LLM) is detected
• Elicit structure from both data and domain experts• Limit nodes to ~15–20 key indicators to keep inference tractable
• Node examples: “Negative tenant sentiment” → “Higher vacancy forecast” → “Lower DSCR” → “Elevated default risk”
Causal Inference
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ (Most Complex)
• Identifies true cause-effect• Provides direct intervention guidance• Eliminates spurious links
• Heavy data requirements• Strong, hard-to-test assumptions
• Treatment-effect estimation• Policy-impact forecasting
Essential for capital‐allocation questions (“Will a £5 m energy-upgrade reduce churn?”) where you need evidence beyond correlation
• Secure natural experiments or panel data• Rigorously test instrumental variables or parallel-trend assumptions
• Apply Difference-in-Differences: properties that underwent a sustainability retrofit vs. similar controls to measure effect on lease-renewal rates• Use causal forests to quantify heterogeneity by tenant segment


How to Proceed
	1.	Immediately: Run a small Factor Model on your combined indicator set to produce 3–5 risk factors for PM dashboards.
	2.	Short‐Term: Build an Ensemble Tree model to generate daily risk scores and rank which signals (numeric vs. text) drive most risk.
	3.	Medium‐Term: Define your portfolio hierarchy and deploy a Multilevel Model—blending national/regional sentiment with asset-level ML scores—to show risk “waterfalls” from macro to micro.
	4.	Selective Deep Dive: For flagship assets or major strategic bets, construct a Bayesian Network for scenario planning; reserve Causal Inference for next year’s ROI studies on key interventions.



Slide Title: ML & LLM Evaluation + Governance ― One-Page Executive View

⸻

1 . Evaluation Stack

▪ Data → Model → Deployment → Monitoring
	•	Data Quality – completeness, bias, lineage, PII checks
	•	Model Performance – accuracy/ROUGE/BLEU (ML), truthfulness/fact-recall (LLM)
	•	Robustness & Stress-Tests – adversarial inputs, domain shifts
	•	Fairness & Ethics – disparate-impact metrics, toxicity screens
	•	Explainability – SHAP, attention maps, chain-of-thought audits
	•	Continuous Monitoring – drift alarms, human feedback loops, incident logs

2 . Governance Pillars

Pillar	Key Artefacts & Controls
People & Roles	Model Owner • Responsible AI Officer • Red-Team Lead
Policy & Standards	Model-Risk Tiers, Secure SDLC, RLHF/RTBF guidelines
Process Gates	Data-Use Approval → Model Card → Pre-Prod Sign-off → Launch Go/No-Go
Documentation	Datasheets • System Cards • Change-Logs • Audit Trails
Oversight	Cross-functional AI Governance Council; quarterly attestations

3 . Key Guardrails for Real-Estate Portfolio Context
	•	Numerical ML indicators: enforce feature versioning; verify against historical market regimes
	•	Text / Transcript LLM signals: mandate factual-consistency evals (e.g., retrieval-augmented truth checks)
	•	Decision Transparency: link every automated risk score to explainable factors for PM review
	•	Regulatory Alignment: EU AI Act (high-risk), NYDFS 500.3, forthcoming UK AI regulation

4 . Success Checklist

✅  Metric dashboard live & owned  ✅  Red-team playbook executed quarterly
✅  Model cards stored in central repo ✅  Alert-to-action SLA ≤ 24 h

(Speaker note: finish by emphasizing that evaluation without governance is brittle, and governance without quantitative evaluation is blind.)
