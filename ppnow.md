**Mid-Year Review 2025**

**GenAI Deliverables**

**CommentaryAgent**
In H1, we delivered a significant milestone: a centralized commentary solution across PAG with streamlined integration into wider PMG and Aladdin systems. Despite initial resistance and operational complexities, we achieved substantial centralization within PAG (ESA and CBA), earning strong recognition as strategic partners from key stakeholders like Jacky, Bryan, Jimi, and Laraib. Our partnerships now extend robustly to APM, PMG Tech, and the AI Engineering teams, supported by effective negotiation and strategic alignment spearheaded by Ciaran.

## GenAI deliverables

- CommentaryAgent: In H1, we already delivered Adam’s most critical request: a centralized commentary solution across PAG with wider PMG and Aladdin streamlining. This has been one of the toughest challenges — not only were the code development and new features highly anticipated (providing ample excuses to delay centralization and Aladdin integration), but we also had to overcome “attachment allergy” across PAG pillars as well as among PMG Tech, APM and Aladdin teams. Nonetheless, we’ve achieved majority centralization in H1 within PAG across both ESA and CBA — where Jacky, Byran, Jimi and Laraib now view us as true partners. We’ve also secured strong alliances with APM, PMG Tech and most of the AI engineering teams, and we’re actively collaborating on how best to deliver this 'together' through Aladdin. This has been achieved with intensive wreslting across PMG Tech, APM and AI Engineering teams and I have led Ciaran to play soft/hard act in all the negotiation and it has worked very well. That means we can now start working more closely with all our partners to build and extend the success. This dones't mean thing would go smoothly but we're always adjusting and fighting to achieve the goal. 
	- Impact
		- Through collaboration with Kirsty in PMG Tech, I secured a testing partnership with SAE to trial CommentaryAgent 1.5. They’re providing extensive feedback to improve the current version—an encouraging sign of engagement and investment.
		- Partnering with Kristen C in MASS COO, I reached the “one MASS solution” initiative, streamlining all commentary workflows across MASS and enabling the COO team to exercise stronger governance. Kristen is very happy. 
		- By working with Paul Henderson in BII, I secured testing partnerships across both BII portfolios as well as Katherina’s BSYS portfolios—fortifying our relationship with BII.
		- In collaboration with Jessica C, Sharadh (EJ Scot), and Andrae Allen, I established a working partnership to drive the Aladdin-integration of CommentaryAgent.
		- Engaging with Jacky and his team in PAG ESA, I strengthened our working relationship and was invited to serve as AI Expert-in-Residence on Jacky’s GenAI engagement. I’m also working with Jimi and Laraib to integrate their unique requirements into CommentaryAgent.
		- In collaboration with Molly, Peiyin, and Yoko in PAG Fixed Income, I have maintained our Fixed Income engagement, and I plan to engage with Natalia and Alex in H2 to improve the relationship.  
		- Supporting Bryan in CBA, I facilitated his stakeholder engagement and received very positive feedback from his team.
		- Finally, after presenting the solution to Nish with Adam, we received very positive feedback and solidified our path to Aladdin integration.
		- Other current engagements: USWA, RQA. 

Alturo: In H1 2025, we officially launched Alturo to MASS—and we hit our goals: we built a solid foundation of 10,000 asset-owner records to power GenAI–driven client prospecting. Alturo has transformed MASS OCIO’s outreach from a largely manual process into a systematic, data-driven approach fueled by information declared through the tax bureau. Now, we can not only identify current CIO-team compensation but also see portfolio asset allocations, potential investment advisors, and fee structures. This level of precision has given MASS OCIO unprecedented capabilities. Edward and Alyson presented and praised Alturo at the MASS Town Hall—where COO Kristen also expressed her enthusiasm—and Gabriella (who leads U.S. pensions) has since championed our expansion into pension-client prospecting. Crucially, I wrested control of Alturo back from Nick so that PAG can play a larger role; while my approach was assertive, it paid off by establishing direct relationships with MASS OCIO.
- Impact
    - Alturo achieved double-digit user-login growth in H1 across MASS OCIO, AIB, Multi-Alts, SAE, and LDI.
    - The asset-owner database grew from 200 records at launch to 10,000.
    - We deployed our first GenAI feature—“search intelligence”—allowing users to simply type an asset owner’s name to retrieve insights.


STANZA: We successfully transitioned ownership of STANZA Aladdin Climate to ASA while continuing to support STANZA MSCI. Throughout the handover, we ensured that both ASA and PAG maintained a strong, collaborative relationship—resulting in a smooth and positive conclusion. Dan (MASS) and Mari (RQA), who partnered with PAG on STANZA’s development, both expressed satisfaction with the transition and praised PAG’s unwavering commitment to our stakeholders.
- Impact
    - Ownership of STANZA Aladdin Climate formally handed over to ASA.
    - Ongoing support for STANZA MSCI, with users encouraged to adopt Aladdin Climate STANZA.
    - Strong ASA–PAG partnership preserved through a carefully managed handover.
    - Positive stakeholder feedback from Dan and Mari on PAG’s dedication and execution.


Matchmaking: I became involved to support Ciaran and my manager — since it’s a key initiative for PAG and MASS and I know Mari well. Although the initial ask seemed straightforward, I aimed to be available whenever needed. Over time, I realized I can offer long-term technical advisory — particularly around data quality, matching algorithms, and potential AI involvement. For the data products work, I developed a dashboard that aggregates BLK product data from the BLK website; Mari was very impressed by my ability to reverse-engineer our own web site. Still, we would need the support of GPS team for product data. With so many challenges, the project’s direction has become clearer: after discussing priorities with Mari, we determined we don’t need a dedicated developer resource at this stage. Instead, we need a joint partnership to define what MASS can achieve both strategically and tactically. Our focus now is on ongoing engagement and brainstorming. A particularly positive outcome is that Mari has included me in their CIO AI discussions with PMG Tech, as she sees PAG as a closer partner in supporting their needs.

**Falcon**

We’d been working to secure a direct project with DPO for some time, and the breakthrough came when I produced a GenAI report on the current agentic evolution. Paul G. requested routine catch-ups and accelerated negotiations with AI Lab to transfer the Falcon project to PAG. Winning Falcon is symbolic—it opens our GenAI partnership with Multi-Alts and AI Lab and enhances our AI reputation across MASS and private markets. I’m thrilled to have secured this opportunity to expand our team’s partnership with MASS.

**Skywalker**
I refactored Skywalker to focus on GDELT news and repackaged it as a Python news-aggregation library. I also collaborated with Joy to release the package internally at PAG so that everyone can benefit from its capabilities.

**Gravity**
In my spare time, I completed the first version of the BLK Daily News Solution, enabling users to select relevant news items and send out a daily newsletter.

**Other Developments**
I’ve created a suite of small solutions to boost project management and productivity—Tasko for tracking daily tasks, an attention allocator, a GenAI report generator, an OCIO report template, and PowerPoint GPT. Developing these tools lets me maintain both my technical craftsmanship and creative edge while fulfilling a strategic role at PAG.

**GenAI Expansion**
I’ve launched GenAI education across PAG and am working with the BII team to integrate new GenAI content into the BLK Investor GenAI Education program. Additionally, I partnered with Ji Sun and Adam to broaden PAG’s GenAI presence across AFE and BLK, taking on a more proactive role within AFE. Moreover, I am working with Adam P to get involved with firm-wide initiatives. 

**Writing**
I continue to contribute monthly to Analytics Insider and occasionally write internal updates to share my insights with the my direct reports.

**Hiring**
As EMEA AFE PAG summer hiring coordinator, I’ve supported Hajk and Joy in taking on larger roles. They, in turn, have mobilized additional analysts as advocates. I’m pleased with their leadership—this involvement allows me to gradually transition hiring responsibilities to them over time.

**People Management**
I’m pleased with how I manage my direct reports, Ciaran and Joy, despite their differing personalities and work styles. Both are highly motivated to deliver the best solutions. With Ciaran, I continue to harness his talents while managing occasional misaligned corporate behaviors; with Joy, I’ve seen her reduce non-project activities and increase her involvement in projects like STANZA, Alturo, Corp Comms, and Falcon. With Eleanor, I have changed my way of supporting her by 

I’ve also strengthened relationships with Jacky and Ishan. Jacky and I now meet monthly to explore better collaboration, and he’s invited me to serve as AI Expert-in-Residence for BGM. With Ishan, I’ve maintained ongoing discussions about sharing AI developments in the U.S. With junior individuals, I have continue engaging with Steve, Hanyue, Ayo, Yoko, Sahaiti, Enrico, Molly; With VP level, I have continue engaging with Jimi, Laraib and Thomas.
