Before joining BlackRock 4 years ago, I watched a documentary called The Biggest Little Farm, which follows two dreamers and their beloved dog — as they leave their tiny L.A. apartment and head to the countryside to build one of the most biodiverse farms in existence, in complete harmony with nature. I’d recommend this film to anyone about to launch or pivot their career: it’s full of lessons that pay off in the long run.

If you’re a dreamer, you might imagine swapping a city address for a plot of land where you can apply everything you’ve learned over the years. You could grow beautiful crops, fruits, and vegetables; raise livestock; and let nature work in your favor. The same principle applies in the solutions business: if you’re handed a blank canvas — or a piece of land — you can dream up countless ways to succeed. People love your solutions; they’ll rally around you, praise your work, and spread the word.

Of course, Little Farm’s founders discovered it’s never just “plant and harvest”. They had to systematize their operation — figuring out how to compost waste, recycle water, and integrate every component into a seamless whole. In our world, you can’t just write code and show it to stakeholders: you must consider how your solution fits into the wider investment process and the Aladdin ecosystem. We even have the term about “Aladdinization” to get everyone thinking in systems. But that’s still a superficial layer of integration.

Little Farm’s founders weren’t prepared for two brutal realities: nature’s non-linearity and uninvited animal guests. Dreamers seldom plan for wildfires or invasive species — they pour all their energy into what excites them. Little Farm faced near extinction when a forest fire threatened to wipe out everything. That’s our first lesson: non-linearity. Some things are beyond our control, and they can hit us hard. What truly defines success is how quickly and creatively we turn lemons into lemonade. You can complain about bad luck, unfair or you can adopt a growth mindset, stop playing the victim, and find a way forward.

Then there are the “animal intruders”. The farmers initially saw coyotes as enemies who preyed on their livestock. It turned out, though, that coyotes actually helped control gopher populations, which are beneficial in moderation but destructive in large numbers. And gophers only remain in balance if you also have predators — like coyotes and, later, owls (which arrive only after a fully mature ecosystem develops, often four to five years in). To protect their chickens from coyotes, the farmers introduced a guard dog that wouldn’t harm poultry but would keep coyotes focused on gophers. This is systems thinking: avoiding snap judgments (“coyotes are bad, dogs are good”) and recognizing that reality is more complex than it seems.

Owning something — whether farming or a solution — isn’t about flaunting a name or a title. A name alone doesn’t confer any ‘alpha’ — only the narcissistic or ego-driven believe that owning a title or territory makes them superior. Instead, think like the Little Farm founders: you’re stewarding a living system. Naively expecting to plant a few seeds and reap easy wealth is a recipe for disappointment. You must think about how to cultivate your land, make thoughtful choices, build competence, and always stay in growth mindset for non-linear setbacks and the need for systemic thinking. Remember: wildfires will happen, and coyotes aren’t always the villain — they might just be the missing piece you need.
