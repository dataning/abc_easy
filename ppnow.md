Mid-Year Review 2025

Top Achievements:
	1.	Centralized Commentary Solution (CommentaryAgent): Successfully delivered a centralized commentary solution, integrating PAG workflows into Aladdin and PMG systems. Achieved substantial stakeholder buy-in from ESA, CBA, APM, PMG Tech, and AI Engineering teams, overcoming significant initial resistance. Notable collaborations include SAE testing partnerships, MASS COO governance improvements, BII portfolio engagement, and strategic alignment with key stakeholders such as Jacky, Bryan, Nish, and Kristen.
	2.	Alturo Platform Launch: Officially launched Alturo, significantly transforming MASS OCIO client prospecting. Grew the asset-owner database from 200 to 10,000 records, introducing a powerful GenAI-driven “search intelligence” feature. Resulted in double-digit user growth and substantial recognition from MASS leadership (Edward, Alyson, Gabriella).
	3.	STANZA Transition Management: Executed a smooth transition of STANZA Aladdin Climate to ASA while maintaining strong support for STANZA MSCI. Achieved positive stakeholder feedback from MASS (Dan) and RQA (Mari), highlighting strong execution and stakeholder management capabilities.
	4.	Strategic Advisory for Matchmaking Initiative: Provided key technical advisory on data quality, matching algorithms, and AI integration, developing a high-impact dashboard for BLK product visualization. Established PAG as a central strategic partner with Mari and PMG Tech, influencing broader CIO-level AI discussions.
	5.	Falcon Project Acquisition: Successfully secured the Falcon project, expanding PAG’s partnership with DPO, Multi-Alts, and AI Lab. Enhanced the team’s credibility within MASS and private markets.

Contribution to PAG/AFE/BLK Ecosystem:
	•	Delivered productivity-enhancing tools (Tasko, attention allocator, GenAI report generator, OCIO templates, PowerPoint GPT), supporting broader efficiency and innovation.
	•	Initiated comprehensive GenAI educational programs across PAG, coordinating closely with BII and AFE teams, fostering greater strategic alignment and knowledge sharing.
	•	Actively contributed to thought leadership through regular articles in Analytics Insider, enhancing internal knowledge dissemination.
	•	Expanded the team’s strategic presence and engagement firm-wide, notably through partnerships and collaborative initiatives with Ji Sun, Adam, Adam P, and other senior leaders.

Areas for Improvement (Addressable by Year-End):
	•	Matchmaking Initiative Alignment: While strategic relationships and technical advisory have progressed positively, initial uncertainty around resource allocation slowed momentum. Improved clarity and proactive stakeholder alignment early in project lifecycles could further streamline future engagements.
	•	CommentaryAgent Integration Resistance: Although significant integration progress has been made, initial resistance across certain teams (PMG Tech, APM, Aladdin) required extensive negotiation. Moving forward, proactive stakeholder communication and clearer articulation of benefits could mitigate resistance early.
	•	Productivity Tool Adoption: Despite delivering productivity solutions, adoption within PAG remains incremental. Enhancing visibility, internal marketing, and targeted user training could boost broader adoption and impact by year-end.

People Management:

What Went Well:
	•	Effectively managed leadership transitions, empowering Hajk and Joy in summer hiring coordination. Their proactive engagement has enabled sustainable delegation and supported analyst development.
	•	Successfully tailored management approaches to direct reports (Ciaran and Joy), maximizing their strengths and addressing individual developmental needs. Joy notably increased project involvement and focus, improving overall team productivity.
	•	Strengthened internal relationships through proactive engagement across senior stakeholders (Jacky, Ishan) and junior team members, fostering greater internal collaboration, trust, and strategic alignment.

Areas to Improve:
	•	Addressing occasional misalignment in corporate behaviors, particularly with Ciaran, through consistent, clear feedback and structured developmental conversations could further enhance team cohesion.
	•	Further refining mentorship methods and consistency in guidance, particularly for newer team members like Eleanor, would ensure balanced growth, clarity in expectations, and stronger overall professional development outcomes.
