## Scope of Role & Performance Impact

Eleanor has served as lead developer of solution design for the MASS EMEA PM team, owning requests from initial scoping through final delivery—whether from the PM desk or OCIO mandates. She distilled complex requirements into technical blueprints for the ESG Monitor and then led the redesign of sector-tagging logic in the Sectoring initiative—rolling enhancements out across MASS before using those same tags to define the investable universe and map assets in the Wealth-Model prototype. These efforts have positioned her as the future leader of EMEA PM solutions, streamlining workflows across teams.

Eleanor consistently earns “Strongly Performed” ratings by delivering high-impact solutions. She replaced ad-hoc Python scripts with a centralized ESG dashboard and a “logic bible,” reducing review cycles from days to hours. She delivered the Biodiversity Solution for Dutch OCIO clients managing over €60 billion AUM and Nordic pension funds, automating scoring and reporting to cut manual work by 90%—fulfilling the MASS–PAG sustainability agreement. Her sector-tag redesign boosted prediction accuracy by 90% and fed into a Wealth-Model prototype, and her GenAI proof-of-concept for thematic extraction slashed research-prep time significantly, earning praise from BII leadership. These achievements showcase her talent for translating complex requirements into scalable, innovative solutions that drive exceptional efficiency across BlackRock’s EMEA PM solutions.

## Leadership & Culture

Eleanor has demonstrated outstanding leadership and ownership for the MASS EMEA PM team. Equally adept working independently or under supervision, she has delivered key solutions like the ESG Monitor while overseeing an intern’s SDR-module project that yielded a high-impact deliverable. She mentored junior colleague Steve through the Sectoring rollout, ensuring rigorous standards. By orchestrating collaboration with Portfolio Managers, Compliance, and RQA ESG, Eleanor translates complex requirements into designs and integrates them seamlessly with upstream data feeds and downstream governance. Her meticulous approach has improved communication of predictive accuracy and bolstered transparency. Most recently, her GenAI proof-of-concept for thematic extraction further underscores her ability to leverage cutting-edge technology. These efforts have earned consistent praise from MASS stakeholders and PAG AAA senior leaders.

Beyond her projects, Eleanor has driven community and cross-team engagement within PAG. She organized senior-leader roundtables to explore GenAI use cases, connecting the AFE equity-modeling and multi-asset teams to spark innovation. A vocal advocate for inclusion and growth, she actively participates in PAG’s Women’s Initiatives, and contributes to Tech Pillar workshops that share emerging technologies. Through these activities, Eleanor has enriched PAG’s culture of collaboration, diversity, and continuous learning.

## Areas for Development and Additional Feedback

Firstly, as projects grow in scope and complexity, refining the balance between deep technical ownership and broader stakeholder alignment will be critical and this is the deep trait of PAG. There are moments — particularly during the Wealth-Model pilot — where more frequent, high-level check-ins with senior sponsors could have surfaced strategic trade-offs earlier. Elevating those conversations from occasional project updates to structured steering sessions will help Eleanor maintain her technical momentum while securing clearer executive support for future initiatives.

Secondly, as Eleanor takes on more of a people-lead role, formalizing her mentorship approach will amplify her natural coaching instincts. While Steve and the SDR intern benefited greatly from her hands-on guidance, introducing a lightweight, repeatable framework for goal-setting, progress reviews, and knowledge-sharing will ensure that every team member—regardless of tenure—receives the same clarity of expectations and career support.

Third, as Eleanor continues to take on broader strategic responsibilities, sharpening her ability to quantify and communicate project ROI will be invaluable. While her solutions deliver clear operational benefits, formalizing a lightweight metrics framework—linking key performance indicators (e.g., time saved, error reduction, user adoption rates) to business outcomes will allow her to tell a more compelling story to senior leadership and secure priority for future initiatives.
