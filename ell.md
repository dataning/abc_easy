## Scope of Role & Performance Impact

Eleanor has served as lead developer of solution design for the Multi-Asset EMEA PM (MASS EMEA PM) team since January 2023, owning requests from initial scoping through final delivery—whether from the PM desk or OCIO-PM mandates. She distilled requirements into technical blueprints for the ESG Monitor, then engineered its integration with data feeds and compliance pipelines, dramatically reducing manual effort while enhancing transparency and governance. Next, Eleanor reengineered the sector-tagging logic within the Sectoring initiative—improving asset-prediction accuracy and rolling these enhancements out MASS-wide—and leveraged those same tags to define the investable universe and map assets in the Wealth-Model prototype. Through these efforts, she has established herself as the future head of MASS EMEA PM technology, streamlining portfolio-management workflows across teams.

Eleanor has consistently earned “Strongly Performed” ratings by delivering high-impact solutions. In 2023, the ESG Monitor replaced ad-hoc Python scripts with a centralized dashboard, cutting monitoring time by 80% and shortening review cycles from days to hours; the declarative “logic bible” she authored is now a core MASS PM module. In 2024, she co-delivered the Biodiversity Solution for Dutch OCIO clients (over €60 billion AUM) and Nordic pension funds, automating biodiversity scoring and reporting to reduce manual effort by 95%—directly fulfilling the MASS–PAG sustainability agreement. In 2025, Eleanor’s sector-tag redesign boosted prediction accuracy by 90% and fed into a Wealth-Model prototype; a ten-user pilot refined subsequent releases. Most recently, her GenAI proof-of-concept for thematic extraction slashed research-prep time by 60% and earned formal recognition from BII leadership. These achievements showcase her ability to translate complex requirements into scalable, innovative solutions that drive exceptional efficiency across BlackRock’s EMEA PM platform.

## Leadership & Culture

Eleanor has demonstrated outstanding technical and strategic leadership for the MASS EMEA PM team. Equally adept working independently or under supervision, she has delivered key solutions—including the ESG Monitor, Sectoring enhancements, and Wealth-Model prototype—while overseeing an intern’s SDR-module project that yielded a high-impact deliverable. She mentored junior teammate Steve through the Sectoring rollout, ensuring rigorous standards. By orchestrating collaboration with Portfolio Managers, Compliance specialists, and RQA ESG analysts, Eleanor translates complex requirements into precise designs and integrates them seamlessly with upstream data feeds and downstream governance. Her meticulous approach has improved predictive accuracy, eliminated manual work, and bolstered transparency. Most recently, her GenAI proof-of-concept for thematic extraction further underscores her ability to leverage cutting-edge technology. These efforts have earned consistent praise from MASS stakeholders and PAG AAA senior leaders.

Beyond her project contributions, Eleanor has driven community and cross-team engagement within PAG. She organized senior-leader roundtables to explore GenAI use cases, connecting the AFE equity-modeling and multi-asset teams to spark innovation. A vocal advocate for inclusion and growth, she actively participates in PAG’s Women’s Initiatives, mentors colleagues across functions, and co-leads Tech Pillar workshops that demystify emerging technologies. Through these activities, Eleanor has enriched PAG’s culture of collaboration, diversity, and continuous learning.

## Areas for Development and Additional Feedback

Eleanor’s impact over the last two years has been indisputable, but as she steps into broader leadership responsibilities, a few targeted practices will accelerate her growth. As projects increase in scope and complexity, Eleanor should formalize structured steering sessions with senior sponsors—short, recurring checkpoints that secure early alignment on trade‑offs and resource priorities before detailed build‑out. To scale her coaching impact, she could roll out a lightweight mentorship framework: scheduled 1:1s, goal‑setting checklists, and monthly office hours—ensuring consistent career support and freeing her to focus on high‑priority solutions. Finally, dedicating regular “innovation sprints” to external demos, academic research, or vendor proofs‑of‑concept will help Eleanor stay ahead of emerging trends and continue infusing the MASS roadmap with cutting‑edge insights.
