**Matt Ziggler:** Welcome to Excess Returns, the YouTube channel that takes complex investing topics and makes them understandable for everyday investors. I'm Matt Ziggler, joined today by my co-host, Bogum Baronowski, and our very esteemed guest, Robert Hagstrom. Robert, welcome to Excess Returns.

**Robert Hagstrom:** Hello, Matt. Boil, how are you?

**Matt Ziggler:** Good, how are you?

**Robert Hagstrom:** Well, we're extra excited to have you. We're going to jump right into the deep end with this one. You said that you fell into money management by accident. I can relate to this. Now, I was a music major, but you were a poly-sci major. So, what does "accident" mean? How's that outsider perspective helping you?

**Robert Hagstrom:** Yeah, I, uh, I was a political science major, undergraduate, graduate at Villanova University, and had done some writing in college with the, you know, the college newspaper and did some writing for the local newspaper about politics and elections. And I had it in my mind after graduation that I was going to go to Washington and be the next Woodward and Bernstein. You know, that was my big dream.

And got down there for, you know, three or four months and decided, "This place is crazy. This is nuts. I can't quit this." And so I ran back home to Philadelphia and went back to the paper and said, "Listen, I'd love to have a job." And they said, "Well, we can't pay you, but if you, uh, go out and hustle some quarter-page ads in the newspaper, you know, you can have part of that, and we'll let you write a column."

So, you know, I made a promise that I would just knock on doors, you know, out on the Main Line, which is Route 30. You know, I just started, you know, out back there in the suburbs and walked up and down the street. One day, I came across something called Legg Mason Wood Walker, members of the New York Stock Exchange. And I said, "I had no idea what that was." I thought maybe an accounting firm or a law firm. I saw it, and I walked in and introduced myself and said, "Could I speak to the owner or the manager?" And, you know, they took me back, and he said, "What can I do?" I said, "Well, would you like to buy a quarter-page ad in the newspaper?" And he said, "No. Would you like to be a stockbroker?"

That's it. I said, "Well, you know, this is, you know, this is 1984, and the bull market had just started. They were looking for, they were looking for cold callers, right? People to get on the phone." And I thought to myself, I was dating this young woman who I hoped would be my wife, and thought maybe she'd be a little bit more impressed with a stockbroker than a quarter-page salesman. And I knew, I gave it a try.

And so, I had no, you know, no accounting, finance, economic background, all liberal arts. Went into training for three weeks. And the third week, it was the Thursday before we would leave, and I had made a decision that I was going to have to resign because none of this made any sense. They, these brokers would come in with the Value Lines. I don't know, Matt and Bogum, do you remember the Value Line Investment, you know, just rows and rows of numbers and ratios and all this? And it, it made no sense to me. They might as well have been talking Greek the entire time. I had no idea.

But the, uh, instructor, wonderful woman by the name of Laura Lang, handed us a photocopy of the 1983 Berkshire Hathaway annual report and said, "You know, we want you to read this tonight and come back, and we'll have a, a leisurely discussion about this the next day." So I took the Berkshire annual report back to the hotel room and was instantly depressed. There was, it was like 20-some odd pages, no photos, no graphs, no, just a 20-page letter. And it was, you know, guys, I'm wrapping up here. It was a proverbial light bulb went on. You know, he started talking about Rose Blumkin at Nebraska Furniture Mart and Stan Lipsey and Chuck Higgins Huggins at See's Candies. And so, you know, he was framing investing as being companies, products, services, and the people that ran it. You know, there were stories, if you will. And it was, you know, the light bulb went off and went, "I get it. This is what, you know, all..." So it was, it was almost like the numbers, you know, and Value Line grew flesh, got up, they grew, you know, they grew purpose. And they, and so I went back in and I was totally jazzed, and I said, "Yeah, this is it. I get it. I want to do this." And I went into production, and, you know, I did everything, you know, I was like a kid following a ball player, whatever Warren did, I did. If he bought a company, I got the annual report and read it and bought it. And that's basically how I started my career. So I didn't have to unlearn any bad habits. I didn't have to learn modern portfolio theory and efficient market hypothesis and all non-correlative portfolios, all that nonsense. I just started from scratch. As you know, doing what one did, and it made my life much easier.

**Matt Ziggler:** Matt and I have a thousand questions about Buffett, Charlie, and Berkshire, and the books you've written, but I want to ask you about your experience with Bill Miller. You worked with Bill for 14 years, and there's a quote that I really like that stood out to me. You said he shared with you to avoid being stranded on a desert island of absolutes. So I'm curious about some absolute beliefs that you had to abandon. You mentioned you didn't have to unlearn things, but I'm sure there were things you had to abandon.

**Robert Hagstrom:** Well, first, Bob, I have to salute you because you just quoted one of my most favorite sentences that I ever wrote. It was, it was my literary moment when I said, when I wrote this down, I went, "I can't believe you just wrote this sentence," because it really sounded really good. About the only sentence that probably sounded as good, and you remembered it.

Okay, so first of all, back up. Bill Miller, as many people know, was the only portfolio manager to beat the market 15 years in a row. And I knew Bill because when I went into training in 1984 at Legg Mason, Bill was director of research. And this is before they, you know, had really gotten off the lip. I think the Value Trust started in 1982, and he was joint managing it with Ernie Keaney. And Bill was a liberal arts major, too, and he went into military intelligence and then came out and did his PhD work absent a dissertation at Johns Hopkins on philosophy. So he was a big philosophy guy. And he would, he would get, you know, we'd get on the squawk for research meetings, and he'd always have these crazy books that he would recommend. And I'd actually try to go out and find them. This was, you know, this is before Barnes & Noble and before Amazon and stuff like that. And I'd get a copy, you know, occasionally, of what he was talking about and try to read it. And, you know, I would call him from, you know, from time to time and ask him questions. And he said, "Robert, you're about the only guy that I think ever really went out and found these books, much less asked questions."

Bill had a huge influence on me. Uh, people say, you know, "You wrote your dissertation on Buffett?" Well, I did my practicals with Bill Miller. I worked with Bill Miller for 12 years. And his whole, if you were to have a poster child, and, you know, maybe there's several posters, but if you had a primary poster child for investing of a philosopher that should hang in your office, it would be a portrait of, of, of William James, the father of, of American pragmatism. Which, you know, very simplistically, and even Charlie Munger talks about this, do what works. Figure out what's working, right? The term was the cash value of the idea. And if it's working, figure out why it's working, and go about applying it.

> Which, you know, very simplistically, and even Charlie Munger talks about this, do what works. Figure out what's working, right? The term was the cash value of the idea. And if it's working, figure out why it's working, and go about applying it.

And as you know, Bill was the very first value investor to invest in technology stocks. And he figured them out. He went to the Santa Fe Institute and studied complex adaptive systems. And he figured out the modes and, uh, technology. And that went on to, you know, make his career not only extend the 15-year horizon, but, you know, he was a guy that valued Google and Amazon and Dell Computer and, you know, all these companies way back when when the entire value space said they couldn't be valued. And Bill walked them through it and said, "You know, here's a DCF. This is how we think about it." And it was a home run. Now, today, when you look around at value portfolios, almost everybody's got Google. I picked that. Have Amazon? You know, yeah, you know, they have Uber and they have all the... So he was the very first one to break the mold and go forward.

> He went to the Santa Fe Institute and studied complex adaptive systems. And he figured out the modes

So that basically helped me understand that you, it's, what he would call the correspondence theory of truth, that you believe that life, markets, biology, what is deep-seated in just one model, and that's going to explain the world for the rest of your life. Well, living systems evolve, adapt, and change. And, and markets do that as well. And, and thinking does that as well. So he was very big on not getting hung up on absolutes. And, and I find that we're an industry, Bogum, that as soon as we crack the code, that's what we do for the rest of our career, and we'll defend it to our last breath. You know, if I hear one more value investor tell me, "You know, we're going to do really well when value investing comes back into vogue," you know, I want to scream. Because I go, "What? I'm a value investor, and I had a great 10 years." Really. You know, the most mispriced part of the market was technology. I mean, and the proof is in the pudding. If you look at the earnings growth rates of the Magnificent Seven, like Tesla, let's take Tesla out of there, that's a different animal. But if you look at the earnings per share growth rates of Mag 7 for the last 5 years, their stock price has gone up equal to their EPS growth. So this is not 1999 when, you know, Cisco went to 101 times earnings, you know, Nvidia went 40 to 50 times earnings, now back down to 35, 40 times earnings. Google's less than the market multiple. Amazon's 30 times earnings. And never mind the returns on capital, these businesses are through the roof. It's clear to me that that these were the most mispriced parts of the market. And and if you had this absolute view that, "I only buy low PE stocks, low price to book, high dividend yield, contrarian bets. I only buy it if it's deeply out of favor," missed about 10 years worth of performance.

**Matt Ziggler:** It's an amazing balancing act there, and that's such, so many people didn't pick that up from Bill Miller, which makes part of this journey for you so interesting with this. So maybe, maybe it's Bill Miller's books, maybe it was these book recommendations on the squawk box. You also wrote that you didn't truly know who to read until later in life.

**Robert Hagstrom:** Yeah. You don't believe that? I don't believe that. But I do believe that you guys do good research. I got to tip my hat to you. There was a, you're a very quotable man. Yes. The good thing you didn't stick. You make it, you make it easy for us. You make it easy. There was a book, uh, that a guy named Mortimer Adler. Mortimer Adler was University of Chicago. I believe he was very big in the Great Books program and Hutchinson and other guys. But he wrote a book called *How to Read a Book*. And I thought, "Well, you know, I think I know how to read a book." But let's see what Mortimer Adler had. And he basically had the methodology of how to read a book. And this was the best part. And he said, "You know, of all the books that you've read, probably only about five to 10% of them were worth your time in reading them. The rest of them you should have either not read or skimmed through them very quickly and put them down." So he had a message of, not every book is worth your slow, diligent, thoughtful, slow reading of a book. Some deserve it, some don't. And your job is to figure out which ones deserve it and which ones don't.

And your job is to figure out which ones deserve it and which ones don't. [ Power law - power dynamics]

So he kind of set up this multi-stage process of what he called intelligent skimming, where you kind of went, you go through the book's outline. You might, I always go through the bibliography to see if there are any new books in there that I haven't read. Go through the footnotes, you know, about what topics they may be covering. You know, you read the preface real quick, and then I'll jump to the conclusion real quick. You know, people say it spoils the end, but they, it's not like a mystery story, you know. We can jump to the end and, and, and if I think to myself, "There's something here that I don't know, or there's something here that I have not learned before," then I'll start all over again. And then I do what's called quick skimming, which is basically just slide through it as quickly as you can, and you highlight sections and stuff like that. And then if you still feel really jazzed about it, then, then you do what's called synoptical reading, is that you read this book, and then you read other books of the same topic, and you begin to synthesize the ideas together.

And what I found is that when I switched over to that, I could consume a lot more books by topics and figure out which ones deserve my time from those that didn't. And I've been able to cover more territory, if you will, by doing that. So it was just a, I think it was just a process of how to consume more books in the limited time that you have in front of you to consume books. So it changed the way that I thought about reading.

**Matt Ziggler:** Did you have any thoughts on that from when you were growing up, when you were a kid, when you were at Villanova? Did you consume stuff differently before, or was it just no?

**Robert Hagstrom:** You know, do you remember, and I'm probably aging myself, and we had speed, this is when John F. Kennedy was thought to be a great speed reader, and they put a line up on the, you know, board up there, you know, it was a projector, and it would go by like 100 miles an hour, 100 miles an hour, and that was supposed to teach you how to read fast. I didn't, I didn't figure it out that way at all. The book, when I wrote a book called *Investing: The Last Liberal Art*, which was from Charlie Munger. You know, the "walking Yen-ist" was Bill Miller. He actually, you know, was a, a multi, you know, he's a polymath, if you will. But in there, we kind of broke down different chapters and on literature. You know, I wanted to spend a lot of time on literature, but, you know, and we wrote about detectives and things of that nature. But the Mortimer Adler book really stuck out to me as more of not that I learned anything about investing from it, but I learned how to consume intelligently, more productively, books that we needed to get through. So it was when we wrote *Investing: The Last Liberal Art* that I came across that. So it was much later in life, which, thank you for. As again, former music major, I think I found that book about 10 years after the fact that it was published, but it was one of those, "This is obvious to me and intuitive," but nobody had, like, written it down or said it before with this book.

**Matt Ziggler:** This was Charlie Munger's, *The Art of Worldly Wisdom*.

**Robert Hagstrom:** I wrote, I wrote a book called *The Warren Buffett Portfolio* in '99. That was five years after I wrote *The Warren Buffett Way*. And at that time, you, we go to the annual meetings on Monday. And this is before, you know, tens of thousands of people came. And you could actually ask Charlie what books he was reading. And people would go to the microphone and say, "Charlie, what are you reading?" In 1999, he said, "Well, Charlie, what are you reading?" And he said, "Well, you know, Hagstrom's book on *The Warren Buffett Way*. I didn't think very much about it." He said, "Goodness, there wasn't anything original here." Which was true. I didn't do anything but take the annual reports and organize it between, you know, company tenants, management tenants, financial tenants, valuation tenants, and then figured that out, and then just, you know, locked in Coca-Cola and GEICO and Washington Post and America, and said, "Yeah, all this, all meets up." And we did dividend discount models. So there was nothing original in it.

So he was actually very correct in his assumption that there was nothing original about it. Of course, at that time, I was probably, on the, gasping for breath, thinking my writing career was now over. But he generously said, "No, but I got his last book, you know, *The Warren Buffett Portfolio*." And he goes, "I really like that book." I said, "Uh, you know, he's got some very good insights here and some things that, you know." And he goes, "You guys should go out there and buy that book." And of course, you know, the blood comes back into your face, and you, you know, you rise up.

I saw him in the airport after the meeting. Those were the days when Charlie actually rode commercial. And we were in the Omaha airport. He was on a United flight going back to LA. I was on American Airlines, I guess, you know, heading east. And I said, he was sitting there by himself, nobody was talking to him. And I, and I popped up. I said, "Charlie, you know, we've never met. I'm Robert Hagstrom. I just want to thank you." And he goes, "Sit down." You know. And I said, "Well, Charlie, what did you like about the book?" And he said, "Well, you know, the focus investing stuff that you did, and, you know, and you use my, you know, psychology of misjudgments. I really like that. And you really got into this art of worldly wisdom." And boy, and I said, "Well, of all these things, Charlie, what do, what do you think I should crack the code on next?" And he goes, "Well, it's a big undertaking, but, you know, anybody who can attack this *Art of Achieving Worldly Wisdom*..." you know, "will do pretty good."

> I said, "Charlie, you know, we've never met. I'm Robert Hagstrom. I just want to thank you." And he goes, "Sit down." You know. And I said, "Well, Charlie, what did you like about the book?" And he said, "Well, you know, the focus investing stuff that you did, and, you know, and you use my, you know, psychology of misjudgments. I really like that. And you really got into this art of worldly wisdom." And boy, and I said, "Well, of all these things, Charlie, what do, what do you think I should crack the code on next?" And he goes, "Well, it's a big undertaking, but, you know, anybody who can attack this *Art of Achieving Worldly Wisdom*..." you know, "will do pretty good."

And so I sent him a copy of the book when it came out. And in typical Charlie fashion, every letter that I ever sent to him, and Warren doesn't do this, you know, in the old days, Debbie Bazanich would type out a letter, you know, like in the old days. It was great. He would sign it. But Charlie would just handwritten scribble on your letter that you sent him, he'd hand it to Gladys, his secretary, send it back. And he said something like, "Robert, I, you know, I think you've done a good job with what is, you know, a very difficult subject." Charlie, and I just, like, "This is the greatest thing I've ever..." Charlie says, "This is a good job." This is, you know.

So, you know, as a side, and I could tell the story now, but I used, I've told it before, but not in so public a fashion. But someone said, "Well, why do you think Charlie liked *The Warren Buffett Portfolio* more than *The Warren Buffett Way*?" And a Berkshire-ite, who will remain unnamed, you know, said, "I'll tell you why. He said, in *The Warren Buffett Way*, you barely mentioned Charlie. But in *The Warren Buffett Portfolio*, you mentioned about a hundred times."

**Bogum Baronowski:** There you go. I'll always remember that. That's amazing.

**Matt Ziggler:** Take us, take us to the Berkshire meetings. You were at a lot of them. You were at this last one. What was, what was your reaction when Buffett dropped?

**Robert Hagstrom:** Well, you know, reaction to everybody was, um, uh, you weren't shocked. You weren't shocked at it, because you knew the announcement was coming. You were just surprised that it was going to happen that day, in the last five minutes of the meeting. And when it happened, you know, you could hear a pin drop. Then the standing ovation, and everything that went on for, gosh, I don't know, 10, 15 minutes. It was just really quite amazing. But, you know, we had, we had heard that, you know, that Greg was doing more and more. He was obviously vice chairman of the non-insurance business, that had the biggest number of employees, most of the businesses. Burlington Northern, Berkshire Energy, you know, didn't have Geico, that was over there with the G-chain. But, you know, he had been basically running all the non-insurance businesses as a CEO for so many years. And so, you know, we knew, you know, we knew that he was the guy. And, you know, we have high regard for him, particularly because he comes out of Berkshire Energy, which I think is going to, can absorb a lot of capital as you think about the needs to enlarge the grid, electricity, and all that that means. But we just didn't think that it was going to happen, you know, on that day. I guess you, you thought maybe it would be announced in the annual report. But Warren, in typical fashion, you know, he says, "I, when I get information out, I want everybody to get the information at the same time. My investors, you know, my board of directors..." All of, nobody gets any privileged information except, you know, his daughter Susie and Howard, who will become executive chairman. They knew. They were, they were forewarned it was coming. But when he announced it, you know, the world, you know, was the third person that knew that this was coming after Howard and Susie. So, you know, it's going to be interesting. We, I talked to a couple of board of directors after the meeting, and, you know, a lot of, you know, we were saying, "Well, is this it? The last time he's on the stage?" And one of the directors said, "Well, no. He didn't say he was resigning as chairman, Robert. You know, just CEO." So we expect him to say, "Stay on as chairman." Another director said the same thing. He said, "Now, just the roles are reversed. Now Warren gets to be Charlie." So Greg's going to, you know, Greg's going to sit up there and pontificate about the business, and he'll turn to Warren and say, "Anything to add?" "Nothing to." And Warren would probably go on for about 20 minutes. So we're not sure how that was going to work out. But then, you know, we were shot. I guess I would say shot, when he said he's not going to be on the stage next year. And, you know, that was kind of a, you know, 'cause you kind of hope you get some, he gets some Buffett witisms up on the stage. But he's going to let Greg do it. He'll let Greg manage the stage in the way that he wants to. And, you know, Ajit will be there, and other people may be there. But I'll be there. We may not have 40,000 next year, but, you know, we'll have tens of thousands. I think we'll be there just out of curiosity. And Warren says he'll be there with the board of directors on the floor. So we'll see what happens next year.

**Matt Ziggler:** I really like this moment at the very end when he said that if there will be more opportunities at any point in time, to call him because...

**Robert Hagstrom:** Oh, yeah, exactly. And, you know, so I, you know, as people, you know, kind of get the gossip going, you know, "What is Warren doing all day?" And he goes, "He's just reading." That's what he... I so that's what he's been doing for 60 years. That's all he does is read all day. But I, what I thought, Bogum, and you can check me on this, he said, you know, "I could be helpful during periods of crisis, during periods of market crashes." Because that's, you know, there's the essence of Warren, right? I mean, if you think about his consistency over time was his willingness to lean into bad markets. You know, '73, '74, buying the Washington Post, and we can go through the list. But, you know, when people are running for cover and thinking the world's coming in, that's when Warren wants to open up the checkbook. And he was saying to Greg and the board and everybody else, you know, "There'll come a time, you know, there'll be another, there'll be another COVID episode or a financial crisis episode or a tech crap, you know, whatever, there'll be a geopolitical episode." And the market's going to get down 30, 40, 50%. And, you know, some people might freeze, some people might panic, some people might go, "We'd better hold on to the cash. We don't know if the world's going to come to an end." But I'll be available for a phone call, and I might be able to give you some advice. That's pretty cool. I mean, to me, and that's where a lot of money can be made when Warren would say, "Okay, I think you should lean into this." You know, when the market's down 50%, and if Warren says, "I think you should lean into that," that, that could be worth the wait in gold right there. You can make tons of money just from that conversation.

**Bogum Baronowski:** What I saw was somebody who still loves investing.

**Robert Hagstrom:** Oh, yeah, yeah, 100%. You can't, you can't remove it. Whether it's playing cards, which he has always said bridge is like investing, you know, figuring out probabilities, Bayesian inference, when the next card turns, and blah, blah, blah. He just loves playing games. And the greatest game, obviously, is investing. You know, the second greatest game is playing bridge. But, you know, he, he loves reading. Just reads. You know, Mortimer Adler or not. There's no chance that anybody could replicate, maybe Charlie Munger, would replicate the number of pages these guys have read in their, you know, 80-year life. I mean, he was reading, remember? But here's the thing. You know, when we were doing the *Money Mind* book and, you know, doing the philosophical upbringings with his father, you got to remember, you know, he was born, you know, 1930, and there was no television, right? There was nothing. There were no video games. There was no, like, what did you do? Well, you know, you had a, you had a radio station, right? You could listen to the radio. And occasionally Saturdays, you might be able to go downtown and watch a movie. But what did you do? You read. Entertainment was reading. That's what you did. That's what they did at the family. His father, stockbroker, read. Everybody read. And so you, you developed the habits of reading because that's what everybody did. I feel, you know, I don't feel sorry, but I feel, I feel the challenge of the younger generation to become readers because, hell, there's nothing out there to imitate. You walk around, nobody's reading. And you kind of feel like you're the odd man out or the odd person out. But, you know, that's what they did. They read. And so for him, that's, of course, that's what you do. That's what I've always done is I read. And so whether it was black and white, in three stations, or cable TV or streaming or whatever the case may be, is, you know, every day he did the same thing. He read. And well, that turned out pretty well. It worked out for him.

> Whether it's playing cards, which he has always said bridge is like investing, you know, figuring out probabilities, Bayesian inference, when the next card turns, and blah, blah, blah. He just loves playing games. And the greatest game, obviously, is investing. You know, the second greatest game is playing bridge. But, you know, he, he loves reading. Just reads. You know, Mortimer Adler or not. There's no chance that anybody could replicate, maybe Charlie Munger, would replicate the number of pages these guys have read in their, you know, 80-year life. I mean, he was reading, remember? But here's the thing. You know, when we were doing the *Money Mind* book and, you know, doing the philosophical upbringings with his father, you got to remember, you know, he was born, you know, 1930, and there was no television, right? There was nothing. There were no video games. There was no, like, what did you do? Well, you know, you had a, you had a radio station, right? You could listen to the radio. And occasionally Saturdays, you might be able to go downtown and watch a movie. But what did you do? You read. Entertainment was reading. That's what you did. That's what they did at the family. His father, stockbroker, read. Everybody read. And so you, you developed the habits of reading because that's what everybody did.

And well, that turned out pretty well. It worked out for him.

**Matt Ziggler:** Robert, I heard you speak in Omaha at Guy Spear's ValueX event, and I hope you don't mind, I'll bring it up. You talked about concentrated, low-turnover portfolio management, and you emphasized, yet again, just the way you did in your books, that this approach works despite the big drawdowns, tracking error, and volatility. But it's still hard to implement. You wrote the books, people read them, a million copies are out there. People are still not doing it. What's going on?

But it's still hard to implement. You wrote the books, people read them, a million copies are out there. People are still not doing it. What's going on?

**Robert Hagstrom:** You know what I said? You know, it's funny, because I wrote *The Warren Buffett Way*, you know, I met some friends, and they said, "Robert, don't write anymore because you're giving away all the secrets." I'm not giving away all their secrets. They're right there in the Berkshire Hathaway annual report, right? So I wrote the portfolio book, so, "Robert, everybody's going to start to imitate this." I said, "No." I said, "If they did, you know, they would have read the annual reports and, you know, blah, blah, blah."

So there, there was this phrase that Graham had, *The Intelligent Investor*, that Warren picked up on, that investing is easier than you think, harder than it looks. And I always had that ass backwards. You know, I thought the hard part was, you know, figuring out what these companies are worth and doing all the, you know, the calculations, DDM, and stuff like that. And, and today, Jesus, a sophomore in undergraduate can do a dividend discount model. You know, AI can figure out margins and earnings and stuff. I think last at AQR said AI does 80% of the work of his analysts. And I thought to myself, what's the other 20%? And if you think about it, it's what Warren said. The other 20% is, and I don't want to get too far off the "harder than it looks" part, because there's a point to that. But the hard part is trying to figure out the competitive advantage period over time. AI can't solve for that. But anyway, it's a part. I thought, you know, that, you know, the easier than it looks is that, you know, I didn't have to worry about the markets. I didn't have to worry about forecasting the economy. I didn't have to worry about trading and stuff like that. And that's still true.

I didn't have to worry about trading and stuff like that. And that's still true. The harder than it looks part is not so much doing dividend discount models. That is being able to operate independent of the market. People are so enslaved to the market. They know how they perform relative to the market. They know what the market does each and every day. But. And so we do know. And I wrote a book called *Focus Investing*, and it was like three or four years ago that K Mers and Pediger wrote the paper on high active share, where they actually then academically defended those mutual funds that had the highest propensity to outperform had high active share, that they were concentrated. And then the second paper was low turnover. So they brought it all together and academically defended it, and it's no longer debatable. Mean, high active share is a predictor of performance.

And so what we do know is when we wrote the portfolio book is looking at Buffett. Well, Buffett actually had a phenomenal 13 years. But if you look at Charlie Munger, Bill Ruane of Sequoia Fund, John Maynard Keynes, who ran the Chess Fund, he was the very first focus investor. Look at Lou Simpson, who managed the portfolio of GEICO. All phenomenal long-term track records, you know, killed the market, but very high standard deviation, frequency of outperforming the market only 60% of the time. Mhm. If you compare that behavior of standard deviation, low standard deviation, high tracking error, periodic underperformance, it's at odds with what modern portfolio theory teaches. And we could spend an hour talking about the damnation of modern portfolio theory, how Harry Markowitz drove this thing off the bridge when he basically equated risk with price variance, which Warren's risk has nothing to do with price variance. But never mind, that's what modern portfolio theory came up with.

But never mind, that's what modern portfolio theory came up with.But basically, the hard part is running these concentrated, low-turnover portfolios in a marketplace.

But basically, the hard part is running these concentrated, low-turnover portfolios in a marketplace. Mhm. Where it judges you day to day, week to week, month to month. And you get these episodes where your portfolio is out of favor. I've run a global leaders portfolio now almost 11 years. My, uh, average turnover, I mean, my annual performance is about, 80% of the time I beat the market. 60% of the time I beat it on a quarterly basis. 50% of the time I beat it on a monthly basis. And you say to yourself, "Wait, you're only beating the market 50% of the time on a monthly basis? How do you outperform the market?" And this is Bill Miller, which is, "It's not how many times you beat the market plus how many times you don't. It's how much money you make when you beat the market. That's how much money you don't make when you give back." So it's a frequency versus magnitude, right? It's not how frequently you do it, it's how much money you make. So you're looking for slugging percentage, right? You're looking for slugging percentage versus batting average. And in modern portfolio theory, it's batting average. Focus investing is slugging percentage. And mathematically, that's correct. That's the way, if you think about probability theory, that's, that's what the whole, the whole thing's about.

That's the way, if you think about probability theory, that's, that's what the whole, the whole thing's about.

And, uh, but the problem is, Mr. and Mrs. Jones, the media, the consultants, all down the road, go, "No, no, no, no, no. This is not standard deviation's too high. You know, tracking error is way too high. You underperform too much." You know, and I said, "Well, what's the absolute return over time?" "Oh, that's pretty good." But, "No, you're not doing it well during the short period of time." So it, it is, it's hard for people to psychologically, emotionally wrap themselves into the idea that focus investing, as outlined by Warren Buffett and others, is the optimal way in which to manage money. But psychologically, it is incredibly, incredibly hard to live through those days, weeks, months, and years when you're having not even the good years, you're having bad quarters. I mean, I had a horrible first quarter. You know, and what all went, you know, went down during the, we started February 19th with the, um, you know, with the tariffs and things like that, and then as we got into the second quarter, you know, Liberation Day and all that, you know, I think it was down 20% from my high of the year. And, uh, you know, peaked, and since then, we're up about 15%. So I mean, you know, in the first quarter, I'm a goat. And in the second quarter, like, "Oh yeah, this guy knows. He writes books. He's really smart." And in the first quarter, "I don't care if he writes about Buffett or not. He doesn't know what he's doing. He's horrible." And so you live through these roller coasters. And that's the hard part. So I do think investing is easier, side to side strategy. We can talk about that some other time. But it's easier than I ever thought it was. Figuring out earnings, margins. And you do a conservative estimate of the growth of the earnings and do a reasonable discount. You get an idea of what it's approximately worth. But the trick is, you know, hanging onto them during the volatility. I think it was Lou Simpson that said to us, he said, "You know, it, it's the difficulty is not finding these great businesses to invest in. The hard part's hanging on to them." That's the hard part, right? And just think, think about how many times, you know, Coca-Cola underperformed over the 10 years, or Apple's under, Apple, I bought Apple, you know, in 2014, and my 10-year tracker, Apple only outperformed on a monthly basis 65% of the time. Just think, you know, those strings of underperformance, people go, "Oh, you know, time to sell Apple." You know, time to move on. And Mastercard was the same way. Louis Vuitton was the same way. They all had a frequency of monthly outperformance around 50 to 60% of the time. And it's when they're underperforming that people really struggle. That's the hard part. It's not just the underperformance, but the dead money periods. Matt and I talked to Chris Mayer, who wrote the *100 Baggers* book, and we had a fascinating conversation. Great book. How the periods when the stock goes nowhere, and even the Magnificent Six or Seven had long periods of five years or seven years when they went nowhere. I've never had a drought that long on five. And I imagine that's a hard one. Can only that's a that's a tough one. But that's where, you know, Warren's idea of letting the economics determine your progress, right? If there was no price, and it, and Chris, I'm sure, went through the exercise, and his justification for holding something that might have had a dry hole for five years was the economic return was justification enough. And if you looked at the sales and the earnings and the returns on capital, he didn't need the stock price to justify why he owned it, because the stock price wasn't going anywhere. But he obviously had an economic argument that was very defensible, that would have said to him, "It makes sense to hold this, even though I haven't got paid yet." So if the economics, economics are supporting you, that's, that is all you need. And it's during those periods when you're underperforming that which holds you in the game are the economic returns. That's what you have to look at.

**Matt Ziggler:** I have a quick follow-up question. Also in Omaha, you brought up the topic of active management. And we see those studies how it doesn't work. But you make a point that it's the *current* active strategies that don't work. Yep. Can you talk about that?

**Robert Hagstrom:** Yeah, well, so if you go through the, so we look at the SPIVA data every year. SPIVA data is, and you can get it right on the internet. It's the S&P Index versus Active Managers. It's called SPIVA Scorecard. And you go through it. You know, I look at it every single year. It's absolutely amazing. You know, so I just, you know, just to make it simple, we look at the large-cap mutual funds who, uh, go against the S&P 500. And you know, like we look at the 10, we look at three-year record, five-year record, 10-year record. And, you know, vast majority are underperforming the index. And you look at the 10-year, this is 10 years where a fund, uh, basically might have had a different manager, but the fund basically was in existence for 10 years. So, you know, you might have had 2,000 big-cap funds 10 years ago. Today, you have 900. So it was in the survivorship of the 900, and 89% of those funds underperformed the market. Mhm. Now, just think about that. So if you're on the board of directors of this investment company, right, and you've underperformed the market for 10 years, don't you think like there's something wrong? This is, you know, what are we doing wrong that we're not beating the market for 10 years? And for whatever reason, it doesn't change. I, you know, I said this, I think at the Oration, I think I said, I know of no industry on the planet Earth that would have an 89% failure rate over 10 years. I mean, manage, if you're in the car business, and 89% of your cars don't work, or you, or you build airplanes, but 89% can't get up in the air, or 89% of your boats sink, you just have to say, "Well, we need to build this slightly different. We need to think about a different way." But it's only in money management that you can continue to perpetuate a bad strategy for decades. Now, you know, money is the, you know, the greatest weight of decision-making. And you wonder, well, the number of actively managed mutual funds are going down. The number of, you know, active strategies are going down. Where are they going? Well, they were going to hedge funds for so many years until the hedge funds blew up. And now they're not going there. Then they went to private equity. And that worked, you know, starting with Swinson in '98. Now that's blowing up. So it seems to me they're doing everything but concentrated, low-turnover portfolio. Listen for a second. We're sitting here, we're just kind of waving. Hey, hey guys, how you doing? Listen, do you want to try a different strategy? We're over here. And by the way, like this guy Buffett did it, and Charlie Munger did it, and John, there's some pretty smart guys that are doing it. Do you guys want to join in? Nobody wants to jump in the pool, you know? They just don't. I don't get it. You have to explain it to me, Matt, and Bogumil. You have all of this evidence before you, and nobody wants to play the game. It must be such a psychological hurdle. They just can't get there.

**Matt Ziggler:** There's something amazing about putting those numbers on the boards. Trivia for you. Surprise trivia. The most losing team in baseball?

**Robert Hagstrom:** Oh, goodness me. Gosh, I don't know. I should know this, but I don't.

**Matt Ziggler:** The most losing team in baseball is the Phillies.

**Robert Hagstrom:** I'm from Philadelphia. I should know it. It's a hard statistic. It's a hard statistic to swallow as a Phillies fan.

**Matt Ziggler:** Yeah, well, we. What I can say is it's the reps. It's because they've been a team for so long. You could still make a couple of World Series runs.

**Robert Hagstrom:** And bids. Young enough at bat. Don't get me started on the Phillies. We're already five games behind the billionaire Steve Cohen and his Mets. Don't get me started on that.

**Matt Ziggler:** Keep the faith, my friend. Keep the faith. All right, I want to talk about *The Warren Buffett Way*, and it's just, you keep dropping these quotes here. "Easier than you think, harder than it looks." I want you to contrast that, or play with this, expand on it, whatever you want. You want "price is what you pay, value is what you get."

**Robert Hagstrom:** Well, there's an old saying that says, you know, anytime that, you know, prices other than, you know, value, you have to sit down and explain it to somebody, because the tendency is people equate price and value as one and the same thing. If price goes up, it's more valuable. If price goes down, it's less valuable. Of course, in, in markets and financial instruments and stuff like that, that's not true. The value of a financial instrument, set aside, you know, real estate and Bitcoin and Van Gogh paintings, is, you know, the cash flows of the investment, discounted at, you know, at a present value and estimated over a long term at a reasonable price. And that, that's your value.

But, you know, people don't want to get, it's kind of like, that's noise to them. It's like, "Oh, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. If it's going up, you know, it's worth more. And if it's going down, it's worth less." And Warren had a great saying, and he said, you know, even though it's interesting, because if you back up to *Security Analysis*, there was 1934, of the great physics review on the first page, actually, was, you know, Horace, the great Greek philosopher, you know, basically doing reversion to the mean, right? You know, "that which goes up will come down, and that which has gone down will go up." Warren said years later, "You know, polling does not replace thinking." You know, there's some things that go up, they're supposed to go up like 10 times. Coca-Cola, it kept going up, and everybody said it shouldn't go up, and it kept going up. And there are things that go down in price, like Dempster-Hill Manufacturing and ARM implementation companies, and all these disasters that Warren had, that, you know, reversion to the mean would have been a lousy strategy for that. But, you know, if you get, have to get into the nuances of how to think about value, you lose about 95% of the people. Except for this, I do find that the people that are smartest about this way of investing are in fact business owners. Now, they don't come to it naturally, because for some reason, even Graham wrote about this, those strategies that used to build their great net worth by owning a business seems to escape them when they go to the stock market. They end up doing something totally different. But if you get a business owner, and you say, "What are you doing?" I said, "Well, I asked them first. I said, 'What is the most important thing for you?'" And they said, "Well, cash." I said, "Yeah. And why?" And he goes, "Well, I got to, I got bills to pay, you know, I got to put kids through school, and I'd like to pay down the debt and stuff like that. So I really look for cash." And they go, "That's funny. That's what I look for. First thing I do is, like, how much cash is coming?" I said, "What else do you look for?" He goes, "Well, the growth of cash." And I went, "God, really? Me too. I look, I look at growth of cash." That's kind of interesting. I said, "What do you think about margins?" He goes, "I'm always trying to get the margins higher, you know, and get my returns on my invested capital, how much I owe the bank, and blah, blah, blah." I said, "That's exactly what I do." I said, "Do you want to play this game in the stock market?" They go, "You do that in the stock market?" I said, "That's that's what we..." And they get it. They go, "Oh, okay. I get it." Right. And, um, business people seem to resonate to the message because it's exactly the way in which they've built their own net worth. So the puzzle is this, you know, that which is in the private market, and you might remember we did a private equity type thing at Guy's thing too, is why is it that you behave differently when you buy and own a business, private business, why do you then all of a sudden treat the stock market totally different? Price, you know, one in the same game. What was that daily price? Yeah, daily. It is. It really will kill you. Myopic loss aversion, you know, Taylor, all the rest of the guys got it, you know, that price is a killer. And you, modern portfolio theory, you know, got into this ass backwards. You know, it was this little 20-year-old Markowitz who said, you know, "I think I will define risk as variability of returns." Nobody stopped it. I said, "What if you read?" So Graham said, "Risk is margin of safety." Right? You know, if you buy something for less than a margin of safety, that's low risk. If you buy something above the margin of safety, that's high risk. Even John Burr Williams said that in the preface of his book, *The Theory of Investment Value*, which, by the way, Markowitz read in advance of his dissertation and ignored. He ignored *Security Analysis*. He ignored John Burr Williams. He ignored. And the dissertation committee didn't stop him. His thesis adviser didn't stop him. Usually, when you propose a new hypothesis that's contrary to maybe an established theory, you're obligated, academically obligated, to say, "Oh, by the way, there is a different opinion about this. I disagree with it. This is an alternative opinion." He never once said there could be another definition of risk that we can consider, which is, you know, margin of safety and buying things for less. So, you know, it's the mighty price, every day, Bogum, as you said, that is the the slayer, enslaves people. And it's probably, he said to me, the single biggest reason why people underperform the market is they misread what price is. And it's not, it's not always, you know, value. It's something different sometimes. So I know that you feel strongly about private equity being offered to individual investors, and you basically say how it offers returns without the pain, without volatility. It takes the pain of market drops away, but it's still bad news and a bad idea. Can you talk about that?

**Robert Hagstrom:** Yeah, well, it was a good idea when David Swinson was doing it at Yale University in 1998. You know, there weren't that many private equity firms, and there weren't that many private companies that were getting bought out. His whole thesis was not so much non-correlative returns, it was there was an illiquidity premium that you could capture that would enhance the returns up and beyond the S&P 500 index. And so the whole, the whole job from Peter Swinson, if you read his book, was that we were capturing higher returns through this illiquidity premium. And the illiquidity premium hung around for about 20, 25 years. Then all of a sudden, it went away. And if you look at the returns now, we're talking about private equity equity. I'm not talking about infrastructure or credit or, I'm just saying, just the companies. And, and if you look at the returns of private equity, they demonstratedly discontinued, continue to go down and down and down, where today, you know, it's basically the S&P 500. And even growth equity, one of the sleeves within private equity, their 5-year average annual return for the last 5 years is 5% per year. So I'm like, "Well, you could have done the S&P about 14, 15%." And I know it's kind of unusual, but, you know, "What am I paying you for?" Right? So, and Warren's had this beef as well, and he's kind of miffed about it because private equity has made it so hard for him to buy private companies, because there's so many people with so much money going after so many deals, they're not any big discounts. Less. And he's not going to pay up, right? He's not going to continue to pay up. So he's out of the private and he's out of the deals that he used to be able to buy because private equity just throws in so much money. But then Warren said something very interesting. He said, "All right, so, you know, you could have bought a private company, and what were the economics of that company? Sales growth, return on capital, blah, blah, blah." And what was the price? And he goes, "What's kind of interesting about the stock market, had a look at the stock market. I think we got about 4,000 publicly traded companies throughout the markets, down from, I don't know, 6,000." He said, "The economic returns of some of these public companies are far better than anything that I've seen in the private market." Mhm. Right? Okay. And he goes, "And periodically, periodically, the prices that you get for these above-average economic returning businesses are phenomenally cheap compared to what private equity ever would have come up with." So he said to me, "Why?" And he said to shareholders, he goes, "Why would you sit there and spend all your time in a private market when in the public market, you have higher economic returns and periodic, massively mispricing that you can take advantage of? And oh, by the way, you're liquid every single day. You're liquid every..." Why would anybody want to spend all of their time on private equity? And you hit on it, Bogumil, which is they had high returns for a while, and people thought it was a good diversifier and stuff like that. But now the returns can't justify it, and they're still illiquid, right? So you have poor returns and illiquidity. So what's the last game to play? And I'm quoting, you know, Cliff Asness again, he wrote a paper called "Volatility Washing." What they take out now is the arch-nemesis of public securities, or public active investment, which is public price volatility. They take it out. And if you look at some of these private equity deals, it's amazing. It could be a seven-year deal or something like that, but it starts, you know, just by the NAV is a dollar. Six months later, it's like 99 cents. And then a year later, it's like $1.15. And then six months later, it's like a dollar eight. You know? So, you know, there's no volatility until like year seven, and it's worth a magical $4. It's at the very end, when they finally sell it. So during the entire T1 through T7, there's no volatility.

So my, my, my problem with this is that if you look at the buyers of private equity, the first buyers were, you know, large sovereign wealth funds, pension plans, endowments, you know, people like that. They're all selling. They're all selling. They don't, they're like, "We don't want any more private equity. We're to the gills. And by the way, we're not going to sell our public securities right now. We're selling our private equity securities." And so private equity has no deal flow, if you will. They have no cash flow. So if the big guys are redeeming and you can't sell anymore to the big guys, what's your next strategy? Well, the next strategy is retail. And there's $12 trillion in a 401k plan. And as disingenuous as it is, I think for some of these mutual fund companies to say, "Yeah, we think this is, you know, additive for the client. He gets more diversification. He gets, you know, he gets to play in the games that the big guys." I think it basically is about fees and the incentives. You know, the fees of these private equity deals, multi-strategy, whatever the case might be, are much higher than what they're paying on 40 Act mutual funds. And so it's a, it's a problem. It's a problem that, uh, um, you know, it's going to haunt the retail investor.

And so I'm thinking to myself, "Am I a salesman for private equity? And I'm going into a brokerage office, what's my pitch?" And they go, "Well, you know, everybody's selling these things, Robert. Why should we be buying them?" I go, "Well, you know, the return." Yeah, we looked at the returns. The returns are, I could have put the money in the S&P 500, done just as well. Why are we here? And then you go, "You know, this crazy market, this market that goes up 10 to 15%, then down 10 to 15% in 3 months. The volatility is off the charts. What would you like to get rid of that? How would you like to take that nonsense off of your life? What if we basically don't get into the volatility game of the market? Let's play a different game." And you go, "Oh, I don't like that price volatility. Oh, I don't like crazy markets. Oh, I don't like it when the market goes down." "Wait, if I invest in that, I don't have to look at that anymore." They go, "Yeah. You want some?" People will go, "Yeah, I'll take anything. Put the volatility to the market." So there, there's, you know, that's the thing that I have a problem with. You know, there are a lot of people that are going to get hurt by this. They're going to get illiquid. You know, they say that they want, think they can handle 20% redemption in some of these illiquid things. But there was a Blackstone mutual fund, real estate fund, that said that they could handle 20% until about 80% wanted out in the same year. And then that, that's a problem. So this is a big problem.

But then here's, you know, there's the conundrum, right? You want the private equity game, you want to audit your companies, you want to hold them for a long period of time, and then you want to sell them somewhere down the road. But you will only do that with private companies that don't have a daily bid. And why don't you do it with public companies that have much better economic returns, have prices that sometimes are very, very attractive? And if you need to get out next week on an emergency basis, why don't you play the game in the public markets? Mhm. They don't want to play the game that game in the public markets. They, you know, they want to play you the private market. So people are starting to write about it, and, you know, uh, that, you know, people at the Wall Street Journal and Barron's and other people that are bringing this up, and Bloomberg's doing a pretty good job. So, you know, that people should be aware that this is not a slam dunk, and this is not the, you know, the key to riches. And, you know, we hopefully people will be very skeptical. And if they are to allocate, we'll allocate a very small portion of their portfolio.

So that was my, you know, last year, Bogum, I was ranting and raving about modern portfolio theory and how they all screwed this up. This year, I'm yelling and screaming about private equity. I don't know who I'm going to yell at next year. But I've heard something cool.

**Matt Ziggler:** But I'm really glad you brought it to everyone's attention, and I hope this podcast will spread the message more so people pay attention.

**Robert Hagstrom:** Get the facts right. Get the facts.

**Matt Ziggler:** I want to run right up to that line though. So we've already established you're never going to turn around and probably embrace poor Harry Markowitz, and you know, he can leave you one-star Amazon reviews like Charlie Munger, the first way around. He might, but he's not. So what's something that, over this, you know, 40-plus year career, or however many years it's been, where what took you the longest to get on board with, where you did accept it?

**Robert Hagstrom:** Great question. I've never been asked that question, Matt. Great question. Um, well, let's put it this way. What am I working on now? Should we? You know that I, you know, was like, so when we revoked the tenants, I did, you know, put the emphasis on the financial tenants, the dividend discount model, and spit it out, and this is what it's worth. The stuff that's really, really hard, and it's not quantifiable, is management. Now, that's harder to do than it used to be in the old days, before Reg FD, where, you know, I remember going to see CEOs and stuff like that, and you could actually have one-on-ones with them, or you could take the CFO to dinner, and you could really get to know them, and you ask them questions. Well, you can't do that anymore. And so it's very hard for you to get to know management. But that was a thing that I had to work hard at. That there's something here, Phil Fisher was big on this idea, there's something here to understand, look steely-eyed, you know, how do they think about capital allocation?

The other thing that I, that I probably pushed back on was, was does the company have a favorable long-term outlook? And I often took, well, it's had a consistent operating history, which is one of the tenants. It's been doing this for a long period of time. So you take the base rate, and you just say, "Well, you know, probably going to continue to do that." And you, you nick it down on the growth rate after five years, seven years, 10 years, because these things slow down over time. But I never spent a lot of intellectual capital on. Then Warren said, you know, one day, and I give the source for you, but he said, "Of all the mistakes that I've ever made," and if you kind of did all the tenants and said, "Well, you know, Warren, of all these tenants, which one did you make the most mistakes on?" He would say, unequivocally, it was favorable long-term prospects. That which I thought was going to work out well, didn't work out well. You know, whether it was Dexter Shoe or whatever the case may be, is I thought this company was going to be T+10, and at 10 it was going to be this, and it wasn't.

So then that brings you up to, and we talked about this a little bit earlier, which is the area that is most mispriced. It's probably not the dividend discount model, the margins, the, you know, things. It's like it's competitive. How long does it last? How long can I continue to earn a high return on capital? How long can I continue to get a double-digit EPS growth or sales? Who else, you know, here's the big thing that I wake up, who else is in this business with me that's going to take my business away? You know, it's got, you know, Tom Russo at Russo, Gardner, Quinn, who always talks about Amazon. He goes, like, "I'll hope Amazon comes for me last. Let's see if they'll ever in their way, but just hope that they show up the very last." Right? So you kind of think, "Who's the Amazon in my business? Who's the Amazon in my semiconductor business? Who's the Amazon in my cloud business?" And go down the list. I'm always looking over my shoulder going, "All right, who's coming for?" Because, you know, they're coming because they want the high returns on capital, and they're going to try to do it cheaper, at a lower price, and with a...

**Matt Ziggler:** So, you know, it took me 20, 30 years, probably, almost 40 years, basically to recognize when you're compounding money, you might ask me this right, compounding money, once you get the return on capital right, it's really just, are you right about how long it lasts? And if it lasts a long period of time, you don't really have to pay about, you don't have to worry about overpaying for it. You will be made right. When you're compounding at 20, 30, 40, 50%, 100% like Nvidia, if you can do that for 10 years, you can overpay for the stock on T1 and still make a ton of money. So that's something that I begrudgingly now have come around to understanding that where we are as active managers, long-only, concentrated, low-turnover managers, the mispricing is in competitive advantage period, how long these things last. So, you know, it took me 20, 30 years to figure out that's the, that's the most important part, and it's the most difficult part to figure out. You always do the easy stuff first. Hey, you know, let me check off the box on all the easy stuff, right? But the hard stuff is, how long does it last?

**Matt Ziggler:** Well, related to that, in your latest work, you write about Darwinian investing and natural selection. Economic selection. Can you introduce us or reintroduce this audience to those concepts? How investing is Darwinian?

**Robert Hagstrom:** Well, yeah, a certain way. I mean, you know, you kind of think about, you know, this came from Don Farmer, who was an adjunct professor at Santa Fe Institute. He actually wrote a wonderful book about making sense of chaos, which kind of goes into complexity and complex, complexity economics. But he basically did a biological metaphor of how the biology with species and growth of species and mutations and all this works relative to active management. And the overlay is, it's really, very simplistic, but, you know, species and asset management is just your assets under management, right? And, and, and the growth of the species is the growth of your asset management. And then mutations are different strategies. And did the mutation work? Did the mutation end up being more, you know, have a higher number of species than what the original did? And so you kind of begin to think about markets and strategies from a, from a kind of biological situation.

And so, you know, you might argue that, you know, Buffett and the rest of those guys, although they've been doing it for a while, were mutations of modern portfolio theory, right? They kind of decided to do it differently, but their AUM really has not exploded. Then you would get mutations in hedge funds and their assets, AUM, and their species. So you could do the number of strategies, the number of species, and AUM and stuff like that, go through the roof. And then, you know, now the multi-strategy, you know, shops, the pods, now are taking money away. So they're the new species. So you can always see this rise and fall of species, market being rise and fall of mutation strategies that are trying to do something better than what the dominant strategy is at any point in time. And so, you know, you're constantly trying to figure that stuff out.

What's very unusual about investing that you have Warren Buffett and Charlie, especially Warren, that has changed over his lifetime the kind of investing he was doing when he just met Ben Graham and the kind of investing he's been doing in the last 10 years. It is different.

**Matt Ziggler:** Yeah.

**Robert Hagstrom:** Well, it is. I mean, if you think, you know, with Graham, now Graham, you know, his defense, you know, he wrote a, he wrote a methodology that that could be used by any person of any simple-minded precepts, like something low price to book, low, you know, low price to earnings, low price to book, high dividend yield. Anybody could figure that out. And then, you know, got to have a contrarian stance. So there was, there was a methodology, a process that everybody could embrace, right? And you probably would do okay. You wouldn't be in a disaster situation.

And then of course, Charlie convinced Warren, uh, you know, "It's not cigar butts anymore, buying the cheapest of the cheapest things that you could find. It is, let's, let's buy better businesses, even if we have to pay up that they're compounding at a high rate." And so See's Candy ended up being probably one of the most phenomenal investments he ever made that he thought he massively overpaid for, but that led to Coca-Cola. And, and so, you know, he kind of learned from that. And then he was slow to get to Apple, but he did get to Apple. And so even though Apple was less of a technology company, I think in his mind, it was more of a consumer products company. And he recognized that people were just not giving up this consumer product. I think it was less, less about the technology, but the moat and technology is lock-in, right? It's, you know, it's it's positive feedback loops. I had good experience with my Apple phone. Um, I've learned now how to do email, I've learned how to do chat, I've got my apps on here. So, so now I've got this path dependency. And someone hands you a, you know, a Google phone or an Android, and you go, "No, no, no. I don't know how to do the email, that the messaging is different." And, God, I got to change my apps. And so you get this lock-in effect, and the lock-in effect is the moat, right? And then, so lock-in is the moat for these consumer products companies. And, and, but Warren got there. You got to give it to him. He bet $35 billion, and it's a serious number. He, it was Ted Wexczer's stock, but, you know, Warren made the big bet and, kind of figured it out. And, you know, that became almost $200 billion. So that, that, that's some pretty good chump change. So, you know, you got to continue to evolve and adapt, right? William James, figure out what's working, keep moving. I don't know what's going to happen next. But when something starts to happen, I spend a lot of time thinking about it. Like, why is this going on now? I don't always buy it, but I'm always interested in, and, and what's working in the market, and then is there an eco? So is as Demodrian at NYU says, you know, investing is a combination of stories and numbers. So stories start to, you know, give you insights that something's working, there's a story here. And so I look at stories. But then the next thing that Demodrian says is, "What are the numbers? You got to make the numbers work, right?"

So Tesla, what's the story on Tesla? The story on Tesla since day one is, it's a technology company, right? And that's the story. The numbers don't support it, right? The fact of the matter is, Tesla's not a technology company. It's an automobile company. It is still an automobile company. And when you look at the numbers for an automobile company, it makes no sense. I mean, it just, I can't get there from here. So, you know, stories are, you know, give you the impression that something's working. There's a new story out there. There's a new economic phenomena out there. But then you got to go back, it up with numbers. And the numbers then have to support the story. If they can't support the story, then it's that, it's a story, but it's not an investment.

**Matt Ziggler:** How are you thinking about moats and lock-ins and technology with the promise of AI?

**Robert Hagstrom:** That's a tough one. We do think the original thesis on technology and and others is a sense of power law scales, right? And power laws are ubiquitous throughout nature where, you know, by example, the largest city in the world is twice as large as the second one, three times as large as the third one, and on and on. And it works like that in technology as well. If you kind of go through the tech space, number one is twice as big as number two, three times as big as number three, and fourth. So there's some belief at Santa Fe Institute and others that the AI, you want to call them chatbots, whatever you want to call them, AI agents, whatever it is, will follow a power law distribution. And, and that may. I mean, we're still so early in the game. You know, it's ChatGPT, which is significantly bigger than the next one on the list, which would either be, well, it's not Perplexity, it would be Claude, or maybe Anthropic. But they'll probably fall into some kind of power law relationship. Because the cost of, of what it takes to ante up to stay in the game for these new inference reasoning models is more than what, you know, chuck change can buy today. Now, having said that, AI will bifurcate into AIs that need Ferraris to solve problems. You know, we've got now sovereign AIs. There's some big problems in military, sovereign AIs, enterprises, and stuff like that that need Ferraris. They need large language models, and they need video chips. And there's some AI models that are going to be more like Chevrolet Malibus, I mean, not that hard. They're not that difficult. And a Broadcom GPU will be more than enough to get it done. So it depends upon what the workload is. But it, it seems to me that as AI continues to grow, more power is needed, more speed is needed, more volume is needed. Thus far, it looks to me that that it's beginning to follow a power law.

Next on the list is to get usage up, use cases, case uses. We're seeing those go up. We're beginning to see a modest economic return for some of the case uses. But as those become more ubiquitous, you see more case uses, you see people, I mean, the first time you get on a call and you see somebody beat a number, or their margins are better, and the CFO or CEO says, and somebody says, "How did you do it?" And he goes, "AI." Then you're like, "I, it's to the next leg." And because that's what people are wanting for, where's my payoff? It's not just, it's not just the picks and shovels that are getting paid off right now, which we know that's true. It is how this becomes valuable to companies, governments, whatever that says, "Yes, this improved our business." And from an economic standpoint, "We made better decisions. Margins are up. Our earnings are up." Whatever the case may be. They need to know that there's a payoff. And, and I think that's where this is heading.

Unfortunately, I think we're now in what's called, you know, pay fatigue. I think the first couple of years, you know, it was just, you know, it was the greatest jazz in the world. And then we've had these setbacks and pullbacks. We had DeepSee, which I don't really think is all everybody thinks it is, but we can have that argument another day. But I think we're in, I think we're in AI fatigue. There was a guy named Roy Amara who studied technological revolutions. And he, he did a work, you know, his thesis on technology revolutions. And he went back to the very beginning. There's a tendency to overestimate its change in humanity in the short run, but then underestimate it over the long run. And the tendency is, in the short run, you believe it's going to change everybody's life, and it's going to do it instantaneously. But in fact, it doesn't. And people become disenchanted, and they become, "Ah, it's passing faded, this isn't going to." And they totally get out of the gate. And then it does a slow elbow turn until it goes parabolic. And, and, and that probably what's going to happen with AI, that it's going to be a multi-year phenomenon that people will continually underestimate its end use, if you will. But when it shows up one day, you're going to go, "How the hell did I not invest in this?" That's how these always happen.

**Matt Ziggler:** I have to tell you, not a day passes without somebody sharing with me how they're using AI. And it's from a Berkeley University professor, that's a good friend, all the way to an analyst in New York that just started working for an investment firm. The different ways that people are using it and implementing it and making part. I've been investing professionally for 20 years, and I haven't seen a wave of change in how the workflow works that's bigger than it is today. So I'm, I'm excited. I'm curious. And I'm trying to keep up. Matt is one of the people that helps me keep up with it. But I'm fascinated to see how this will change. I mean, you know, we've got, you know, analyst doing AI dividend discount models, you know. And yeah, and you can go back and say, well, you know, what were the earnings in 1985 when interest rates did this and inflation did that? And, you know, you can ask it all these questions and all this analysis and all these correlations and stuff like that. And it comes back, you know, depending upon what you're using, and, you know, and then in a second or a minute or 30 minutes later, depending upon what AI you're using. But there's no doubt about it that, you know, this makes work so easy. But then, if you do this on the next time, ask AI, has it solved an ability to judge a company's long-term competitive advantage period?

**Robert Hagstrom:** Mhm. And it goes below. And, and, you know, they say, and they come back, "Well, I can figure it out if I do it monthly." So, you know, they're basically just, what's going on monthly in the business? I don't know. I'm looking here, it says it's just a, it's a Robert Hagstrom book that just came out. The complexity of it. What do I do with that?

**Matt Ziggler:** Yeah, it's, you know, that strategy piece is the piece that AI hasn't wrapped its hands around yet. That's, as I said earlier, I think that's the, that's the golden egg to figure out. If you figure out that part, Floyd, boy, you could make a ton of money just figuring out those that can do it from those that probably can't do it and separate them out. Boy, that, that would be a home run.

**Robert Hagstrom:** I think it boils down to the quality of questions. The better the quality of the question, the better the output. And speaking of questions, Matt and I have two last questions, closing questions for you. One is, what is the one thing that you believe about investing that the majority of your peers would disagree with?

**Robert Hagstrom:** Drawdowns don't matter. I mean, now you could say, "Caveat, well, a drawdown to zero matters." Right? Well, of course. If you think about it, I mean, and Michael Movius, and I, we haven't mentioned his name, but I think Michael Movius is just phenomenal. He worked with us at Legg Mason Capital Management, but he's brilliant. He actually has a piece that just came out this month about drawdowns, which was brilliant. And, you know, Berkshire Hathaway went down 50% I think three or four times in the last 50 years. And you could think of no greater financial company in your mind. That you know, it's down 50%. Is it going out of business? For you to go, "Oh, let's stop it." So, you know, your chart affairs is every time Berkshire went down 50%, it was to, you know, load up.

I think we, and this is modern portfolio theory, right? I think we're just so, that's our kryptonite, right? Drawdowns are our kryptonite. It, it is, you know, condimented diversity, you know, prospect theory, you know, the pain of go, it's not only the pain of losing a unit, it's losing 50 units, you know, that is so debilitating. And so I said, you know, I've said to people in seminars, I said, you know, people would say, "The market's going to crash. It's, you know, it's going to be terrible. It'll be the end of markets." I said, "Can I ask you a question?" Said, "In a friendly manner," I really am interested to know, "How much bottled water, peach preserves, canned soup, and AK-47s do you have in the basement?" And they go, "Well, I don't have any of that." "Well, if you think the world's coming to an end, you truly believe this, you think you'd be, you know, storing up some bottled water and, you know, firearms and stuff like that?" And I said, "Well, you really must not think the world is coming to an end." And they go, "Well, maybe, but you got to go through that." So I think the period of drawdowns are, drawdowns are the kryptonite. And, and if you've done this enough times, and I've made mistakes, and I have things that, you know, have turned out ugly that, you know, don't want on the tombstone, but, you know, but the most part, there are a lot of things that have gone down a lot that have come back, and I've made a lot of money. If you've got the economics right, drawdowns, you know, should not be your enemy, and they're your friend. But psychology of drawdowns is debilitating for most people.

Through my writing on the podcast, I got to meet a lot of private investors that never accepted outside money, and they're fascinating individuals. And some of them have been doing it for 40, 50 years. They had a completely different career, but obviously the investments are the bulk of their net worth creation throughout their lifetime. And that, I would agree with you, and they would agree with you that drawdowns don't matter. The minute you accept somebody else's money, well, you want me to give you, I don't know how much time you want. You want to give you a quick Bill, Bill Ruane story at Sequoia? Sure. Yeah. All right. So this is, you know, how to solve the problems of drawdowns. So this was, I guess, '97 after the book, '96, '97 after the book. And we were at the baseball game on Saturday, and I was along the first baseline with a, I had a wire fence, and some, I was eating popcorn, and, you know, Warren Buffett was out there pitching. The whip, you know, and Bill Ruane came up, and in silver hair, just handsome, handsome guy. He didn't know me, but I knew him. And I said, "Uh, Mr. Ruane, my name's Robert Hagstrom. I just wanted to tell you how much I, you know, congratulate you on everything that you accomplished at the core of the fund." And he goes, "Oh, Robert. Well, you know, congratulations on the book. I understand it did very well." And I said, "Well." He says, "So what are you going to do?" And I said, "Well, you know, managing some money. We'll see what we can do with it." He goes, "I'm going to give you some advice." I said, "Oh, that's great." He goes, "Well, no, you won't take this advice." I said, "Mr. Ruane, warning, I assure you, if you give me any advice about managing a business or managing a money management..." He goes, "No, you won't." He goes, "I'm going to give you this advice, but you're not going to take it." I said, "Go ahead, try me. Go ahead." He goes, "Well, listen, you know, you're starting a money management business. You know, you look like you're a good kid. You wrote a book. You know, that gives you some street credit. If you kind of do what you do, what you said you're going to do in the book, things will turn out really well." Uh, and there will be a lot of people that agree with you, and then there's going to be a lot of people that don't agree with you, and they're going to, you know, groan and argue, "Oh, you don't own oil. Oil is going up. Oh, gosh, you bought this, but now it's down." It's, and they're going to be a real problem. And my advice to you is this: Fire them. Fire them all. I said, "Okay, why not?" He goes, "No, you're not going to fire them, Robert. You're a young kid. You've got a mortgage. You've got a wife. You've got kids." He said, "Under management is your fees. That is your income. You're not going to." But you will make your life much easier and much more enjoyable if you simply fire the people that don't get it, don't understand it, don't appreciate it, and surround yourself with people that do. And I thought that was a great bit of advice. I did not follow it precisely, but it, I do keep it in the back of my mind to the point, and I'll finish here, which is, if someone says, "I think this is a really good idea," I would say, "Look, here's my deal." I said, "You may be thinking about a dollar you're going to give me, but I'd rather you give me a quarter, give me 25 cents of what you thought you were going to give me, but then leave me alone." I don't want you to argue with me. I don't want you to yell at me. I don't want you to tell me that I don't own this, don't do that. Said, "We'll do it my way. I'm going to do this. And you know, you take the 75 cents and you can give it to somebody else. But for the dollar you give it, just let's run this, you know, strategy." And we've had some that have done it, and then they've added, when we've gotten through the bad times, come out on the good times. But sometimes you got to put them on training wheels. There's been a piece to it before you actually get it full bore. So, that's kind of a life lesson that Bill Ruane taught me.

**Matt Ziggler:** That's a beautiful story. All right. One more question for you. We're thinking a lot about Warren Buffett for all the reasons. What's a lesson you think you've learned from Warren they'd want the average investor to also learn?

**Robert Hagstrom:** Well, there, you know, he had tremendous life lessons, you know, about working with people that you love, working a job that you love. And if you get both of those, you know, right, life is pretty good. But as an investor, and this may be the hardest one to swallow right now, because of all the politics involved, but I mean, this is a guy that, you know, when he bought his first share of stock at 11 years old, in 1942, the war in the Pacific wasn't going that well. It could have gone either way. But you're talking about a guy, and his dad was a big, you know, a big God Bless America guy and tremendous influence on his life. But I think if you're going to invest, you got to believe in your country. You got to believe in the spirit of democratic capitalism. You got to believe that no matter how many body blows, and we've taken some body blows in the last 60 years, um, we, you know, you could go back and look, just Google news events for each year for the last 60 years, and your jaw will drop thinking about what it's been like to be an investor in markets. You know, presidential assassinations, Cuban Missile Crisis, race riots, you know, national guard on street corners, by the way, tanks underneath traffic lights, you know, we've been through that. We've been through a lot. But somehow or another, we always get out on the other side. And, and, and somehow or another, that sticks with me. And I think, you know, once again, it's the world doesn't come to an end, as long as the spirit of democratic capitalism can thrive, and it has good days, bad days, good years, bad years, good administrations, bad administrations, whatever the case may be. But if you believe in that spirit of democratic capitalism can survive, can thrive, can proceed, then then everything else is going to work out fine. Then the rest of it's easy. Just go find some good companies and ride this, you know, just ride this. That's all you need.

**Matt Ziggler:** Robert, if people want to follow more of your work, get the books, is there, are there any locations they can look you up on the internet these days?

**Robert Hagstrom:** Well, you know, Amazon's a gorilla. I mean, they've got it all. I've written some things about the books on Amazon. You know, I think that's, you know, the easiest way. We do some pretty good work here at Equity Compass, but I'm not here to sell portfolio strategies. I think, you know, educate. If you get the education part right, the rest of it will do well. You know, build a library. It's not only *The Warren Buffett Way*. There are other good books that have been written about Warren and Charlie. As he said, you know, the real trick in life is just pick the right heroes. And if you pick the right heroes, and you imitate, emulate, you know, duplicate, whatever you want to say about your heroes, you have a pretty good life. And I can tell you that's exactly what I do. That's exactly what I do.
